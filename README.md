**ðŸ“˜ Terraform Modules and Learning Projects**

This repository contains my hands-on learning, practice modules, and mini-projects built using Terraform â€“ an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. It includes real-world examples and challenges to provision, manage, and automate cloud infrastructure (primarily AWS).
